# U-Net Model for Image Segmentation

This repository contains two versions of the U-Net architecture for image segmentation tasks:

1. **Original U-Net**: The classic U-Net model used for various segmentation tasks.
2. **Enhanced U-Net with Batch Normalization**: An updated version with Batch Normalization layers added to improve training stability and performance.

## Model Descriptions

### Original U-Net
The original U-Net model is a convolutional neural network developed for biomedical image segmentation but is also effective for general image segmentation tasks.

### Enhanced U-Net with Batch Normalization
This model builds on the original U-Net by adding Batch Normalization layers after each convolutional layer. This modification helps the model learn more effectively and often results in improved accuracy.

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AnandaKrishnan11/unet-segmentation.git
   cd unet-segmentation
